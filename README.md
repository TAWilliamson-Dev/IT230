# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?
  Both versions of this application were designed with a student seeking to register for a given set of Computer Science classes in midn.
# What did you do particularly well in developing this application?
  These projects gave me an opportunity to learn more about C# and refine my iterative development process.
# Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  The console version of the application relies on output formatting to make the program as user friendly as possible within the constraints of a CLI program. However, the WPF version of the program, with a more fully realized UI, is much better oriented towards the aveage end user.
# How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
  I primarily relied on a long standing focus on an iterative development process, even within the small scope of the projects in this course. It is important to compartmentalize new code and test against 
  as many of the obvious potential errors as one can. While a developer can never account for all possible fail states, it is important to at least handle the most likely faults that can occur within a program. In the case of the WPF console register student application, the event of a user attempting to add an element from a drop box prior to making any selection. Without checking again that null value, the application would fault, but by catching that we can enhance the interactivity of the program by drawing the users attention to the fact that they have yet to make a selection.
  possible errors
# Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?
  While very little of the code in this program could be considered innovative, it was still a worthwhile experience and enhanced my understanding of the C# programming language. Further the material covered in this courss
  gave an opportunity to enhance my ability to debug other programmers code.
